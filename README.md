## What's an 'Ace of All Trades'?

Everyone on earth has a specific skillset that they acquired through time and work. For each of these skills, there's a level of understanding, starting from zero ("I don't know anything about this subject"), to medium ("I'm pretty knowledgeable at this subject") up to high ("I know everything there is to know about this subject").

In order to understand the meaning of 'ace of all trades', we must explain each level of skill understanding. The following list starts from lowest to highest.

**Jack/Ace of No Trade**: Someone who's neither decent or a master of anything **Jack of One Trade**: Someone who's decent at something but bad at everything else **Ace of One Trade**: Someone who's a master something but bad at everything else **Jack of All Trades**: Someone who's decent at everything but a master of none **Ace of All Trades**: Someone who's a master at everything

**DISCLAIMER**: It is impossible to be a true master at everything on earth, just like it's extremely hard to be very bad at everything. There are also lots of sub-categories that I won't get into, since someone can be an 'ace' at more than one skill or decent at only a couple skills. Most people find themselves in category 2, 3 or 4.

## Keeping track

I'll be posting flaired updates as time goes by, hopefully daily or at least once a couple of days. The flairs will contain stuff like 'minor update', 'major update', 'project' (for the skills that actually lead to launching a product or service), etc.

In these updates, I'll also be including specifics in order to prove what I claimed to learn. This will include actual code, previews or links to external websites/platforms where I post my work. By doing this, it will allow the community to comment on my progress, give me insight or judge the level of understanding I hold towards that skill.

## Expectations

Starting out, I plan to minimize 'all trades' to only internet-related skills, mainly in the professional area: design, programming, marketing and so on. An "Ace of All Digital Trades". With time, I will hopefully expand this by removing the 'Digital' term and starting skill learning on trades outside of the internet. This could come in a couple months or never, who knows?

Timeframe: I'll give myself 10 years for the 'digital' plan. I'm 21 now so at about 30 I should complete this challenge, with enough time to cash in on my projects and retire by chasing other skills in the real, physical world. Do I think I'll be able to complete this in only 10 years? No, but as the motto goes, "I'd rather fail at trying to become extraordinary than succeed at becoming mediocre".

## The process

The plan, for now, is to pick a main skill, which will take most of my time, then a secondary skill which is related to the main skill, all while practicing additional skills here and there in the rest of the time.

For example, I believe that web development (html, css, js + frameworks) is a must for this journey, since most of the skills and projects I plan on launching in the future require web dev knowledge, so this will be my main skill. UI/UX (User Interface) Design will be the secondary skill, since it ties into web development and will allow me to produce beautiful apps & websites. They pair together well and allow me to branch into other fields in the future.

This post will be updated frequently to keep up with changes and progress. Stay tuned.
